# archiveist

This repository is the result of me walking through all archives on the [wayback
machine](https://archive.org/web/) for gothamist.com from 2015 until now. I looked at any article
that was linked to from the homepage and tried to dig through to find author names. 

**Follow [this link for a per-author](https://github.com/CoreyLoose/archiveist/blob/master/gothamist/) 
dump of the found articles** 

The archive was not run everyday, it looks like it averaged out to every-other, so some articles are
bound to be missing, but I hope that what's here is helpful to somebody.

The same process can be re-used for other *-ist properties (laist, dcist, chicagoist, sfist, Shanghaiist, dnainfo),
but it takes a bit of time. If you're interested in a specific site's history, please send me a message and 
I can run it.
